# Generative Text AI with GPT-4

This project involves the development and testing of generative AI models for text generation, specifically using the GPT-4 architecture. The goal is to create a model that can generate coherent and contextually relevant text based on an initial input.

## Project Details

We will be working on fine-tuning the pre-trained GPT-4 model using a custom dataset. This model can then be used to generate text for a variety of applications, including but not limited to chatbots, content generation, creative writing and much more.
